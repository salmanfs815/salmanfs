When JMC was open-sourced, one of the main tasks for our team at Red Hat was to make it widely available to our developer community.
This meant packaging the application for Fedora.

Fedora is a distribution of Linux sponsored by Red Hat.
It is the bleeding edge of free software and the upstream source of Red Hat's flagship Enterprise Linux distribution, RHEL.

I was tasked with packaging an RPM for JMC.
This allowed me to take a deep dive into Maven, Eclipse RCP and RPM build tools.
